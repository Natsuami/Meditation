					This is your body's <a class="hover link-dark" href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-stress-response-3145148" target="_blank">stress response</a>, otherwise known as your fight-or-flight response. In some cases of extreme danger, this physical response is helpful. 
					However, a prolonged state of such agitation can cause physical damage to every part of the body.<br></br>

					Meditation affects the body in exactly the opposite ways that stress does—by triggering the body's relaxation response. 
					It restores the body to a calm state, helping the body repair itself and preventing new damage from the physical effects of stress. 
					It can calm your mind and body by quieting the stress-induced thoughts that keep your body's stress response triggered.

			<tr>
				<td><p>The ancient practice of meditation has been used by civilizations around the world to calm and focus the mind toward greater physical and mental well-being. 
					Through various techniques and approaches to find this calm, peaceful &amp; relaxing meditation is a practice that millions of people incorporate into their daily lives.
					<br></br>
					Where did meditation come from? Scholars suggest meditation dates back to hunter gatherers in the Indus River Valley around 5,000 B.C.E.
					They were depicted as engaging in meditative practices. Throughout history, almost all world religions developed some form of meditation, making its exact origins difficult to pinpoint. 
					Modern meditation practices are generally attributed to Buddhism in India.
					<br></br>
					Meditation’s long and widespread history suggests that societies and religions around the world came to meditation as an important contributor to their belief systems and well-being. Early meditation was tied heavily to religion, bringing individuals and communities deeper spiritual connection. Today, meditation is practiced outside of its religious roots, becoming a ritual that has proven to provide positive health outcomes.
					There are many types of <a class="hover link-peach" href="how-to.html" target="_blank">meditation to learn</a> as well as the ability to study and become a certified meditation teacher.
					<br></br>
					Meditation focuses more on spirituality and inner awareness than adhering to a particular belief system or doctrine. 
					It is clear that praying, and meditation build upon similar practices and goals, but they are not dependent on one another.
